ai_starting_info_old = '''Module: Hello! Welcome to the worldbuilding module. 
My purpose is to assist you in creating a concise description of an imaginary world. 
Let's get started by sharing some basic ideas about your world. 
Once you provide me with those, I will generate an outline for you. 

After that, I will present you with various options:
    
You can choose to:

    1. Generate a new world: discard your current progress and begin afresh.
        
    2. Inject random concepts: several random words that will be interpreted by the AI and 
        incorporated into the world's description. You can decide how many random words to inject and 
        whether the injection should be aggressive. A non-aggressive injection will make minor 
        changes to the world, while an aggressive one might alter the direction of the world 
        based on the random concepts.
        
    3. Inject non-random concepts: similar to the previous option, but instead of random words, 
        you input the specific words/concepts to be used.
        
    4. Super-weirdness (aggresive decliche + inject random): this option will make the world 
        quite strange and almost unrecognizable, but it has the potential to generate 
        unique outcomes.
    
    5. Rebalance world: this option will keep the changes made so far while attempting 
        to reintroduce your original ideas to the world.
        
    6. Cliche reduction: this option will minimize cliched elements within the world. There are 
        two modes available: aggressive mode, which can significantly alter the world to avoid 
        what the AI perceives as cliches and stereotypes, and non-aggresive mode, which will 
        only soften some of the more stereotypical elements.
        
    7. Darken the world: makes the world more grimdark.
    
    8. Brighten the world: makes the world sunnier and more heroic.
        
    9. Shorten the text: condense the length of the description.
        
    10. Generate a chapter: create additional detailed text that describes an element within 
        the world, such as a group, race, place, or conflict. This text will be independent of 
        the general description and will not be altered alongside it. It is recommended to 
        generate chapters after finalizing the description.
    
    11. See what you have: display everything you have created so far.
        
    12. Display memory: display all the versions of your world that have been created in the 
        current session.
    
    13. Clear data: delete various data, including chapters, word definitions, and memory.
    
    14. Load world from memory: replace the current world description with a 
        version from memory.
    
    15. Load world from file: import a saved world description from a file.
        
    16. Save the world!: save the world description, along with chapters, definitions, substitutions, 
        and memory, to a text file on your computer.
